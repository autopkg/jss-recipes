# How to contribute to jss-recipes

**NOTE: The recipes in the jss-recipes repository will stop working in a future version of Jamf.** Please consider switching your JSSImporter workflows to JamfUploader instead. Details: https://grahamrpugh.com/2022/02/16/jssimporter-jamf-pro-api-token-auth.html

3. In your new copy of the repo, make whatever changes or additions you like. Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages.

4. If you create or modify recipes, make sure to use the included validator to make sure the recipe matches the expected behavior of jss-recipes:

    ```
    $ ./validate_recipes.py Atom/*.recipe
    --------------------------------------
     Testing recipe: Atom/Atom.jss.recipe
    --------------------------------------
    OK
    ```

5. Once you're all done, submit a pull request back to our jss-recipes repo.

    ![Pull request](img/pull-request.png)

    One of the repo's owners will review your changes (usually within a day or two) and respond accordingly.

Thanks for contributing!
